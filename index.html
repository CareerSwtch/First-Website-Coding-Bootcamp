      <p class="intro-text">I love problem-solving, almost as much as I love a good pen. I get the most satisfaction when I get to help others tackle a challenge they have that prevents them from doing what they are passionate about.

        <h3>My interest in Software Development</h3>
        <p>I first became interested in programming when I got expossure into portfolio theories between my finance lectures and internships, after I discharged out of the military. During this time, I became fascinated with the scale of running models through Python vs. the traditional laborious Excel pathway. My interest remained for the following years as I worked in tech sales, continuously challenging myself through the technical frameworks of the product I was selling.</p>

        <p>I'm looking to start my career in Software Development, where I will have a balance of support around me and challenges continuously.</p>
